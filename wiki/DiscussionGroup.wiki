#summary Description and rules for the cmslib-discuss group.

The CMS-library discussion group is the place where anyone can go to ask questions or discuss issues with the CMS-library design and code.

You can browse the archives and post new topics [http://groups.google.com/group/cmslib-discuss here].

Anyone can post in this group (and we hope you will!), but please don't abuse this possibility. We'd like to read lively discussions there, but expect to see:

  * No trolling, personal attacks, flame-wars, or any of that bad stuff. We won't go into specifics. We hope we don't have to.
  * No off-topic conversations. This will not be enforced with an iron fist. But please try to keep the discussions related to CMS.
  * Reasonable spelling / grammar. It's no problem if English is not your first language, but try to make an effort to make your contributions easy to read.

We would like not to have to restrict posting to members only. Of course, in the future we may be forced to, to help prevent spam.

That's it. Have fun!
